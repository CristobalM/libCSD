This project develops a C++ library implementing the compressed string 
dictionaries described in:

==========================================================================
  "Compressed String Dictionaries"
  Nieves R. Brisaboa, Rodrigo Canovas, Francisco Claude, 
  Miguel A. Martinez-Prieto and Gonzalo Navarro.
  10th Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA'2011), p.136-147, 2011.
==========================================================================

Furthermore, we also implement some other techniques which provide additional
space/time tradeoffs for the problem of managing string dictionaries in
compressed space.

The code will be released as soon as possible. 

Thank you very much for your interest.
